Hi! <br>
My name is Tommaso Canova, people know me also as __cannox__, my friends sometimes describe me as a *funny dwarf*, I don't know if they are right or not, in case we meet you may will discover it by yourself (*just kidding, I'm not funny at all*).

## 🤓 Something about me

&emsp;🎓 &ensp;I'm attending the MSc in Artificial Intelligence at University of Trento

&emsp;🎓 &ensp; On Septembrer 2022 I've graduated in Computer and Electronic Engineering at University of Trento, with a grade of 110/110 cum laude:

&emsp;💻 &ensp; I'm the Team Leader of [E-Agle Trento Racing Team](https://github.com/eagletrt/), the [Formula SAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_SAE) team of [UniTN](https://www.unitn.it/), I'm also an Embedded Software Engineer in charge of the Low Voltage Accumulator Battery Management System (*BMS*)

&emsp;🤖 &ensp; I'm interested both in Artificial Intelligence and Embedded Systems, the last one pushed me to learn a lot of Electronics during my Bachelor 

&emsp;🏉  &ensp;I'm very keen on **tech** and **electronics** and I've been a **rugby** player until my 22 y.o.

&emsp;✅  &ensp;I'm a big fan of bullet lists
