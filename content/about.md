## Hi!
I'm Tommaso Canova, a MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at University of Trento interested in tech. 
On this website I try to store my projects and thoughts.

## Me in a bullet list
🇫🇮 **Erasmus+** student at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) (Finland) \
🎓 Graduated in Computer and Electronic Engineering at University of Trento, with honours\
🏎️ Former **Formula Student Member** (more about [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_Student))\
🏉 Former **Rugby** Player\
🤖 Interested in Artificial Intelligence, Embedded Systems, Electronics and Entrepreneurship

## Past experiences
🏎️ **Team Leader** of [E-Agle Trento Racing Team](https://eagletrt.it) (the Formula Student team of the University of Trento) for the season 2022/23\
💻 **Embedded Software Engineer** at E-Agle TRT, in charge of developing the *Low-Voltage Battery Management System firmware* (more about it [here](https://github.com/cannox227/fenice-bms-lv) and [here](https://wiki.eagletrt.it/fenice-bms-lv/)) season 2021/22 and 2022/23\
💾 **Computer Technical Specialist Intern** at [App Informatica](https://www.appinformatica.com) in Valencia (Spain)


## Things I'm doing right now
🥶 Currently [freezing](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/local-weather) in Finland \
📳 Working on a [GAN-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) audio watermarking model for deepfake detection\
📷 Working on [Camera dewarping](https://github.com/cannox227/camera-dewarping) for top-view court stitching applied to Basketball and Volleyball
🦿 Studying Reinforcement Learning and Complex Networks \
🧖 Having sauna 

## Projects
⚡️ [Fenice-EVO BMS LV](https://github.com/cannox227/fenice-bms-lv): main project during my Formula Student experience \
⚙️ [Step Motor Test Bench](https://github.com/cannox227/Step-Motor-Test-Bench): Measurement tool to extract maximum power and torque of a step motor (Bachelor's thesis)\
☀️ [Solar Azimuth and eLevation Motorized lOcator (SALMO)](https://github.com/cannox227/Solar-Azimuth-and-eLevation-Motorized-lOcator): a custom PCB used for driving a tracking solar panel system, using GPS location and a MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) algorithm to maximise the incident power\
🔊 [HiFi Watermark](https://github.com/cannox227/hifi-gan-watermark/tree/watermark): U‑Net based deep learning architecture for Watermark embedding and retrieval on HiFi‑GAN generated audio.\
🏃🏻‍♂️[Digital Health and Human Behavior project](https://github.com/cannox227/Digital-Health-and-Human-Behavior---Project-Course): Analysis of physical activity patterns using the Fitbit Fitness Tracker Dataset
